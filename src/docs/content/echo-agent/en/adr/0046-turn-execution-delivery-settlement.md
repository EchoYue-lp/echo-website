# ADR 0046: Separate Turn Execution and Delivery Settlement

## Status

Accepted

- Date: 2026-09-14
- Owners: `echo-orchestration::runtime`, `src/acp`, and the external SDK Host consumer

## Context

`AgentTurnDriver` owns the execution terminal of a driven turn, while a sink
may commit a Journal/Ledger fact, render a protocol projection, or notify an
extension observer. These operations happen after the driver has observed the
producer terminal. Treating every sink error as a new `TurnOutcome::Failed`
creates contradictory records: ReactAgent trace and final answer can say
Completed while the returned receipt says Failed.

## Decision

1. Keep `TurnOutcome` as the only execution terminal authority.
2. Add `TurnDeliveryOutcome` to the same `TurnReceipt` with
   `NotAttempted`, `Delivered`, `Closed`, and `Failed(AgentFailure)` values.
3. Classify a producer terminal before invoking the sink. A delivery failure
   after that point cannot rewrite execution outcome, final answer, message
   identity, usage, or compaction accounting. A non-terminal sink failure still
   cancels the invocation and yields framework `Failed` because no producer
   terminal exists.
4. `SinkControl::Closed` before a producer terminal is a driver-synthesized
   cancellation; after a producer terminal it only records delivery `Closed`.
5. ACP keeps Journal/Ledger before projection and observers, persists the
   complete receipt, and returns `end_turn` only for `Completed + Delivered`.
   Delivery failure is returned as a bounded protocol error without downgrading
   the stored execution status or terminal.
   `persist_run_settled` is the standard Prompt's single receipt writer;
   `run_spawned` cannot start a competing persistence task.
6. `RunReceiptWire` carries optional delivery fields for old persisted records.
   New records always write the delivery status and, when failed, the lossless
   `AgentFailureWire`. Missing fields remain `legacy_unknown` and are never
   inferred as successful delivery.
7. Durable write and recovery validate run identity, terminal/outcome/final
   fields, delivery/error pairing, and committed-versus-observed watermarks as
   one settlement record. A corrupt combination fails recovery instead of
   recreating conflicting terminal authorities.
8. `AgentChannelHandler` is also a driven Turn consumer. It creates a fresh
   transport stream/Turn identity for each inbound message, scopes the
   conversation by channel, conversation, and sender, and exposes the
   `TurnReceipt` through `drive_turn`. Its standard `MessageHandler` path
   produces an outbound reply only for `Completed + Delivered` with a final
   answer. The channel sink accepts envelopes without inventing a second
   terminal reducer; `SessionHandler` still owns session generation and the
   transport delivery fence. The raw Rust `Agent::chat` and stream APIs remain
   valid low-level contracts for callers without a driven Turn promise.
9. Channel session reset passes the generation cancellation token into handlers
   that declare driven settlement. For those handlers, reset retires delivery,
   requests cancellation, and waits for the active driven setup to release its
   receipt before acknowledging replacement. Legacy/custom handlers keep the
   earlier drop-on-cancel behavior unless they opt into the settlement method.
   `drive_turn_with_sink` lets adapters attach a real Journal/projection sink;
   the default sink only records in-process event acceptance and is never
   described as remote QQ/Feishu delivery.

## Alternatives rejected

- Letting a projector or observer own the execution terminal duplicates the
  driver and makes cancellation, trace, and provider state diverge.
- Making all projections best-effort hides delivery loss and prevents callers
  from deciding whether a result is safe to retry or display as delivered.
- Adding a new RunHandle operation for delivery status duplicates the receipt;
  SDK clients read the field from `RunGet`/`RunWait`.
- Introducing an asynchronous outbox here would also require new retry,
  retention, ACK, and cleanup policy. Those remain separate delivery-ledger
  work when a concrete consumer needs them.
- Treating a channel's returned text or raw stream EOF as a Turn terminal
  leaves cancellation, producer failure, and usage without a receipt.

## Consequences

The framework exposes two explicit, non-overwriting facts for every driven
turn. Adapters must check both before claiming successful execution and
delivery. `RunStatus` and `RunTerminal` remain execution projections; a run may
be `Completed` while its delivery is `Failed`, which is an observable and
recoverable delivery condition rather than a second execution terminal.

The driver watermark (`TurnReceipt.last_event_sequence`) is the last envelope
observed by the driver. The ACP Ledger watermark is the last envelope accepted
by that ledger; Journal or projection failure may make these watermarks differ.
Channel receipt delivery refers to the channel event sink, not a remote QQ or
Feishu delivery ACK. The transport's generation fence remains responsible for
local queue/network admission and reset ordering; a remote send failure cannot
retroactively change the Agent's producer terminal.
`ChannelManager::stop_all` now retains the handler until its awaited close
succeeds. Sender-scoped Agents are settled by `SessionHandler`, while the
generation fence still guards network admission. The resource-close ordering
is recorded separately in [ADR 0066](./0066-agent-adapter-close-ownership.md);
it does not add a competing Turn terminal. Finding #107 remains governed by
its own remote-main acceptance evidence.

## Industry Basis for Channel Adoption

Codex exposes a finite Turn completion result and separate progress/usage
notifications; Claude Agent SDK reports a final ResultMessage after streamed
progress. Both keep the terminal independent of merely observing output or EOF
([Codex app-server protocol](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/main/codex-rs/app-server-protocol/schema/json/v2),
[Claude Agent SDK streaming output](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/streaming-output)).
Tokio's graceful-shutdown model separates signalling cancellation from waiting
for tasks to finish ([Tokio graceful shutdown](https://tokio.rs/tokio/topics/shutdown)).
The channel adapter applies these existing framework principles by awaiting
one `TurnReceipt`; it does not introduce another lifecycle authority.

## Verification

Focused driver tests cover all terminal kinds, terminal and pre-terminal sink
failures, Closed, missing terminal, and stream-start error delivery. ACP adapter
tests in this repository and external SDK Host tests cover Journal/observer
failure, wire validation, persistence, and legacy receipt decoding. Full
framework and independent SDK gates remain required before closing Finding
#108.
Channel adapter tests additionally cover a real driven receipt with identity
and usage, standard reply projection, producer failure, cancellation, custom
sink failure, and Session reset waiting for a real cancelled Turn to settle.
