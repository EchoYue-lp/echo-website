# ADR 0040: Workflow Checkpoint Lease and Sibling Settlement

## Status

Accepted

This decision applies to the workflow checkpoint and pipeline execution paths.

## Context

Workflow resume currently claims a checkpoint by renaming it out of the
pending set, then parses and consumes the claim before node execution has
settled. A read, parse, delete, or process failure can therefore make a
continuation invisible. A concurrent tag can also load an old checkpoint and
save it after a resume claim, resurrecting a continuation. Pipeline fan-out
and DAG execution wait in submission order and only abort siblings after the
first observed failure, so a pending sibling can hide the terminal error or
outlive a cancelled caller.

## Decision

The existing `CheckpointStore` remains the sole checkpoint authority. A
successful `claim` creates a lease identified by `resume_attempt_id`; the
resume path acknowledges the lease only after the continuation reaches a
terminal result and requeues it on any failure. Stores with expiring claims
publish a heartbeat interval; `Graph` renews the exact attempt while its resume
future is active, and a missed or rejected renewal cancels that attempt before
settlement. Claimed files remain visible to `load` and `list`; only claims whose
heartbeat is older than the store lease may return to the pending set. Metadata
updates use an atomic generation
compare-and-save; adapters without that primitive reject the update rather
than using a racy load-then-save fallback. Default settlement methods return an
unsupported error, and SDK component stores transport renew, acknowledge,
requeue, and generation-CAS explicitly instead of reporting a successful no-op.

Parallel workflow paths use the existing node futures or `JoinSet`, observe
the first completed failure, cancel all siblings, and drain their handles
before returning. Dropping a `JoinSet` also aborts its child tasks when the
caller cancels the outer operation. The streaming graph entry emits
`WorkflowEvent::NodeError` before the terminal stream error and never emits
`Completed` for a failed node. Successful `ConcurrentWorkflow` and
`DagWorkflow` executions buffer completion-order results by their registration
or topological batch index before producing merge inputs and `steps`, so
fail-fast observation does not make successful output order nondeterministic.

## Alternatives considered

1. Keep eager claim deletion and retry from the caller. Rejected because a
   process crash leaves no recoverable record and retry cannot distinguish a
   consumed continuation from a failed claim.
2. Preserve load-modify-save for tags. Rejected because it permits ABA
   resurrection after claim; generation CAS makes the conflict explicit.
3. Wait for every sibling before propagating an error. Rejected because a
   hung sibling can mask a failure indefinitely and cancellation drops can
   detach external effects.
4. Extract a new workflow scheduler/state machine. Rejected for this slice;
   the existing `CheckpointStore`, `Graph`, `JoinSet`, and node execution
   paths remain the authorities.
5. Recover every claim after one fixed age without renewal. Rejected because a
   valid long-running continuation can cross that age and be executed twice.
   Renewable visibility leases are the common pattern used by Temporal
   Activity heartbeats, Amazon SQS visibility extension, and Kubernetes Lease
   `renewTime`.

## Consequences

Resume failures remain retryable and observable, while successful resumes are
settled exactly once per attempt token. This prevents concurrent duplicate
execution but does not claim global exactly-once effects after process or
network failure. Tagging a claimed checkpoint returns a conflict
instead of reviving it. Parallel failures now have bounded cleanup and a
deterministic terminal error, while successful merge and step projections retain
their prior registration or topological order. Remote checkpoint adapters must implement the
new atomic settlement methods to support tagging and failure recovery; the
compatibility defaults fail closed where atomicity is unavailable.
