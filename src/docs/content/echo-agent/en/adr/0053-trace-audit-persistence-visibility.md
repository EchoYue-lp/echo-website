# ADR 0053: Separate Diagnostic Persistence Delivery from Execution

- Date: 2026-09-15
- Owners: `src::trace`, `echo_state::audit`, `src::agent::react`

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Trace and Audit are optional observations of an Agent execution. Their direct
backend APIs already return `Result`, but the React integration discarded
several backend errors. A failed initial trace save still published a run ID,
the default `RunStore::append_event` treated a missing run as success, and
Audit callbacks could drop events without a machine-readable failure fact.
`FileAuditLogger` also returned success after a buffered flush without a
durability barrier and could not recover a crash-torn final JSONL record.

These failures must be visible without allowing a diagnostic backend to
replace the Agent producer's Completed, Failed, or Cancelled terminal.

## Industry References

- The OpenTelemetry
  [error-handling specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/error-handling.md)
  says runtime telemetry failures must not significantly change instrumented
  application behavior. Suppressed failures should be logged through
  language-specific diagnostics, and SDKs may expose a separate configurable
  error handler.
- The OpenTelemetry Logs SDK
  [export contract](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/sdk.md#logrecordexporter-operations)
  returns an explicit Success or Failure to the processor, while ForceFlush
  and Shutdown report error or timeout independently from the application
  operation that produced the log.
- Tokio tracing-appender exposes an
  [ErrorCounter](https://docs.rs/tracing-appender/latest/tracing_appender/non_blocking/struct.ErrorCounter.html)
  for lossy non-blocking output. This makes intentional telemetry loss
  observable without turning a formatting writer into application authority.

The common pattern is to preserve the producer result, represent diagnostic
delivery failure separately, and expose loss through a dedicated result,
handler, or counter.

## Decision

1. `RunStore` and `AuditLogger` remain the only persistence authorities for
   their records. Their direct methods are required operations and continue to
   return `Result`.
2. Agent-integrated Trace and Audit writes are diagnostic delivery. A backend
   failure creates `DiagnosticDeliveryFailure` with a record family,
   operation, occurrence time, optional identity, and backend error. The
   failure never contains the diagnostic payload.
3. `DiagnosticDeliveryObserver` is the notification boundary. The producer
   performs only a bounded non-blocking `try_send`; a process-local diagnostic
   dispatcher emits the stable tracing target
   `echo_agent::diagnostic_delivery` and then invokes an optional application
   observer. Queue saturation, disconnect, dispatcher initialization failure,
   reentrant reporting, and observer unwind increment the saturating
   `diagnostic_delivery_dropped_count`. A blocking observer can delay later
   diagnostic notifications but cannot delay the Agent producer.
4. A failed initial trace save does not publish a trace run ID. Append and
   finalize failures are reported with `append`, `load`, or `finalize`
   operations. Missing runs are failures, including the default
   `RunStore::append_event` implementation.
5. `AuditCallback` and direct React audit sites report rejected records through
   the same observer. They remain observational callbacks. An application that
   requires an audit record as part of a business commit must call
   `AuditLogger::log` directly and bind its `Result` at that commit boundary.
6. A successful `FileAuditLogger::log` means serialization, write, flush, and
   `sync_data` completed. Reopen validates every complete JSONL record. Only an
   invalid final record without a newline is treated as crash-torn and
   truncated; a valid non-newline final record is terminated, while complete
   corruption fails closed without mutation. A lifetime file lease prevents a
   second live logger from racing recovery or append; callers share one logger
   through `Arc`.
7. Metrics and skill-usage telemetry remain a separate best-effort class. They
   may expose counters or warnings but do not create Trace/Audit delivery facts
   and do not change Agent execution.

## Alternatives Rejected

- Failing the Agent turn when Trace or callback Audit persistence fails would
  create a second terminal authority and contradict the producer result.
- Returning only `Option<run_id>` after an initial save failure conflates
  disabled tracing with rejected persistence and can publish phantom IDs.
- Logging unrelated warning strings at each call site is not a stable
  structured contract for filtering, counting, or alerting.
- Adding a retry queue or delivery ledger would require retry, retention,
  shutdown, and ownership policy not needed to close this failure-visibility
  gap. A future durable diagnostic outbox must be a separate decision.

## Consequences

Framework consumers can distinguish execution outcome from diagnostic
completeness. Existing Agent calls keep their producer result when optional
diagnostic persistence fails, while a default tracing subscriber or custom
observer normally receives one structured failure fact for each rejected
operation. The bounded drop counter is the explicit signal that this
best-effort notification path itself lost evidence.

`FileAuditLogger` performs a data durability barrier per record, which costs
more than buffered flush. Consumers that need lower-cost lossy telemetry should
use a telemetry backend rather than weakening the Audit success contract.

A `sync_data` error has an unknown physical outcome: the record may already be
present even though durability was not established. The callback integration
reports the failure and does not retry blindly because AuditEvent has no
idempotency identity. Retry/outbox semantics require a separate contract.

This ADR does not close `finding.in-memory-audit-successful-drop` (#61), which
tracks an in-memory backend that currently reports success after a poisoned
lock, or `finding.trace-audit-secret-boundary` (#103). The observer never adds
record payloads, but custom backend error text remains subject to that separate
retention/redaction audit.

Application-provided observers are trusted local extension code. Running them
off the producer path contains blocking, reentrancy, and unwind panics; Rust
`panic=abort`, process termination, and a permanently blocked diagnostic
dispatcher cannot be recovered in-process. These conditions may lose later
notifications and are reflected only by the counter when the process remains
alive.

This change adds a public observer API but no protocol field, state machine,
store, terminal event, or SDK wire authority.

## Verification

Focused tests cover missing-run append, failed initial trace save and stale ID
clearing, append/load failure observation, Audit callback failure observation,
successful producer completion despite Trace and Audit failures, blocking,
reentrant and unwinding observers, `SyncData`-backed file writes, path
replacement, crash-torn final record recovery, valid non-newline tails, and
complete corruption rejection. Full workspace and SDK contract gates remain
required before closing Finding #46 on main.

Final-save failure coverage uses the canonical `AgentRunSnapshot::finalize_run`:
the initial save and subsequent load succeed, while the terminal save fails.
`FinalizeSaveFailingRunStore` is a private test injector with a bounded save
counter, not a second production persistence or execution authority. The test
observes a Finalize delivery failure without changing the producer terminal.
The real stream driver also uses a private in-memory wrapper that accepts the
initial save and running appends but rejects the terminal save. It returns the
producer final answer and emits exactly one Finalize delivery failure. Both
injectors remain test-only; neither owns a production execution terminal.

The public inventory generation and review now belong to the independent
`echo-agent-sdk` repository. Framework verification does not complete that
obligation or close Issue #46; process-local observer/control APIs remain
Host/Rust-only or deferred until the SDK owner refreshes and classifies them.
