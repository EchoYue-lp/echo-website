# Plugin System

EchoAgent uses the Agent Plugins 1.0 root manifest, Skills, and MCP conventions in a flat package tailored to a local personal assistant. Every supported component has one fixed location; there are no client-extension namespaces or component path declarations.

## Package layout

```text
my-plugin/
├── plugin.json
├── skills/
│   └── code-review/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── mcp.json
├── agents/
│   └── reviewer.md
├── hooks/
│   └── hooks.yaml
├── lsp.yaml
├── monitors.yaml
├── themes/
├── output-styles/
├── scripts/
└── README.md
```

`plugin.json` belongs at the package root. There is no `.echo-plugin/manifest.yaml` compatibility path.

## Manifest

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
  "name": "review.tools",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Review workflows",
  "author": { "name": "Example Team" },
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["review"],
  "displayName": "Review Tools",
  "defaultEnabled": true,
  "config": {
    "endpoint": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Endpoint",
      "default": "https://example.com"
    }
  },
  "dependencies": [
    { "name": "base.tools", "version": ">=1.0.0" }
  ]
}
```

The portable identity fields follow Agent Plugins 1.0. EchoAgent also reads the root `displayName`, `defaultEnabled`, `config`, and `dependencies` fields. Unknown top-level fields are reported and ignored.

Plugin names contain 1-64 lowercase ASCII letters, digits, hyphens, or periods. They begin and end with an alphanumeric character and contain neither `--` nor `..`.

## Standard Skills

Skills use the fixed `skills/` root. Each immediate child is one skill:

```text
skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

EchoAgent does not recursively discover nested category directories for plugin Skills. An invalid Skill is skipped without disabling sibling Skills or other plugin components.

## Standard MCP

MCP configuration uses fixed root `mcp.json` and the Agent Plugins schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/mcp.schema.json",
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-review": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${PLUGIN_ROOT}/server.js"],
      "env": { "CACHE": "${PLUGIN_DATA}/cache" },
      "cwd": "${PLUGIN_ROOT}"
    },
    "remote-review": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-Tenant": "public" }
    }
  }
}
```

Supported transports are `stdio`, `streamable-http`, and legacy `sse`. A stdio `command` is one bare executable name or a plugin-relative path beginning with `./`; it is never interpreted by a shell.

EchoAgent provides `PLUGIN_ROOT` and `PLUGIN_DATA` to stdio subprocesses. `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${PLUGIN_DATA}` are expanded once in `args`, environment values, and `cwd`. They are not expanded in environment keys, commands, remote URLs, or HTTP headers. A plugin cannot override the two reserved environment variables.

An invalid top-level `mcp.json` disables only MCP for that plugin. An invalid, unavailable, or colliding server disables only that entry.

### MCP ownership and projections

The `name` key remains the portable local server name. At runtime the framework
qualifies it with its owner: direct configuration uses `McpServerOwner::Direct`,
while plugin wiring uses the stable `PreparedPlugin.id`. Thus two plugins may
both declare `filesystem` without sharing a connection or cleanup debt. Use the
typed `McpServerId`/`server_ids()` APIs when the owner matters; legacy string
APIs continue to address direct servers.

Direct tools retain `mcp__<server>__<tool>`. Plugin tools use
`mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__<tool>` with a stable digest suffix when the
canonical Unicode or punctuation name is lossy. Resource selectors are opaque
`plugin:<base64url-plugin>:<base64url-server>` values. The resource directory
keeps the typed identity and does not infer an owner from a tool name or URI.
Direct names keep their legacy selector except reserved `plugin:`/`direct:`
prefixes, which are reversibly escaped as `direct:<base64url-name>`. A plugin
Hook `mcp_tool.server` remains a local name in the package and is qualified by
the prepared plugin owner before registration.

## Fixed local components

The remaining components are discovered from fixed root locations:

| Location | Consumer |
|---|---|
| `agents/*.md` | Subagent adapter |
| `hooks/hooks.yaml` | Hook registry |
| `lsp.yaml` | Embedding application's LSP manager |
| `monitors.yaml` | embedding application scheduler |
| `themes/*.json` | embedding application GUI/TUI theme catalogs |
| `output-styles/*.md` | embedding application system-context projection |

`scripts/` and `README.md` are package resources rather than automatically executed components. Skills and Hooks may reference scripts explicitly.

## Framework and application boundary

The reusable framework owns manifest parsing, Skills, MCP, plugin scopes/lifecycle, Hooks, Subagent definitions, and LSP adapter output. An embedding application discovers and converts only its product-specific `monitors.yaml`, `themes/`, and `output-styles/` files. The application integration does not duplicate dependency ordering, component ownership, or reload semantics.

## Discovery and lifecycle

The registry scans these scopes:

| Scope | Default location |
|---|---|
| User | `~/.echo-agent/plugins/<name>/plugin.json` |
| Project | `<project>/.echo-agent/plugins/<name>/plugin.json` |
| Local | `<project>/.echo-agent/plugins.local/<name>/plugin.json` |

Applications can override the plugin data base directory. embedding application sets it to `<application-data>`.

Loading proceeds in dependency order. Fatal manifest errors skip the package. Framework-parsed Skill, Hook, and MCP errors remain isolated at the component boundary and are recorded as error diagnostics; unreadable frozen Subagent or LSP documents are omitted the same way. Their product-specific syntax is validated by the embedding application's second preparation stage. Healthy siblings remain in the prepared plugin. Runtime replacement records ownership so disable, uninstall, and reload remove exactly the components contributed by each plugin.

`PluginIntegrator::prepare` captures one immutable `PreparedPluginSet` with a monotonic generation,
deterministic content identity, structured diagnostics, parsed Skills/Hooks/MCP, and owner-qualified
Subagent/LSP documents. `wire_prepared` and rollback perform no component file reads. Disk changes
become visible only after registry mutation or explicit invalidation. See [ADR 0012](../adr/0012-immutable-plugin-preparation.md).
Generation ordinals are allocated across all integrators in the process, so independent integrators
can publish successive snapshots to the same Agent without resetting their order.

Each `ReactAgent` still owns one publication target, but hosts drive complete lifecycle
transitions through `PluginCoordinator`. Construct it with the durable registry and integrator,
then call `coordinator.reconcile(&mut agent)` for current intent or the typed `enable`, `reload`,
`disable`, `uninstall`, and `shutdown` operations. A failed transition returns `ActualPending`;
call `coordinator.retry(&mut agent)` to resume its exact receipt and phase before starting another
operation. The coordinator serializes transitions while the target remains the sole generation,
publication receipt, and cleanup-debt authority.

The registry dependency graph fixes transition order: dependencies activate and emit
`PluginLoaded` first, while dependents deactivate and emit `PluginDisabled` first. A converged
receipt is valid only for the same Agent publication target. Registering lifecycle callbacks after
convergence invalidates the no-op fast path so the next reconcile activates them. A wrong Agent is
rejected before registry intent or callbacks can change.

Registry intent commits before runtime convergence. Callback cleanup therefore precedes exact
receipt withdrawal, immutable generation publication, callback activation, and lifecycle Hook
notification attempts. Dependency resolution and generation-wide applicability validation happen
before callback cleanup, so invalid input preserves the old actual generation and retry reparses
repaired package files under the same operation receipt. Shutdown withdraws process-local effects
without disabling durable intent.
Registry refresh commits only after a complete scan and preserves the last successful scope set;
a restricted Host view is never widened by coordinator retry.
`PluginLoaded` and `PluginDisabled` attempts are ordered and de-duplicated within one operation;
they are not a durable cross-process event log. Cancellation or process failure can lose a Hook
notification, which remains part of the broader Hook producer contract.
An unfinished receipt reports `ActualPending` at the next retry phase, including after its future
is cancelled.
Each successful MCP connection enters the pending receipt before the next server begins. A name
that was absent before connection is reserved for cleanup across cancellation during its await;
failed new connections settle that name before the generation may publish. This does not change
the separate owner-qualified MCP identity work tracked by #75.

The set remains applicable when a component diagnostic is present. It is rejected only when a
generation-wide invariant, such as dependency ordering or generation allocation, prevents building
the complete immutable snapshot.

`PluginLifecycleManager` owns callback cleanup separately from component wiring. A failed
`deactivate`, `init`, or `activate` retains cleanup debt and blocks further callback activation
through `reconcile`, `activate_enabled`, and direct `activate`. The failed registration remains
available for a cleanup retry; successful deactivation settles its deactivation debt, while
failed initialization requires shutdown but not deactivation, and failed activation requires
successful `unregister` cleanup. A failed callback is
not treated as withdrawn merely because the desired enabled set changed. Failed `shutdown` remains
unsettled even if a later `deactivate` succeeds, and must be retried through `unregister`. See
[ADR 0060](../adr/0060-plugin-lifecycle-reconcile-settlement.md). `PluginCoordinator` composes that
callback authority with durable registry intent and Agent-bound publication receipts; it does not
copy callback or generation state. See
[ADR 0069](../adr/0069-plugin-host-lifecycle-coordinator.md).
An init or activation retry first uses `PluginLifecycleManager::reset_for_retry` to settle the
failed callback's own deactivate/shutdown debt without replacing its registration.

## API

```rust,no_run
use echo_agent::agent::ReactAgentBuilder;
use echo_agent::plugin::{
    InstallSource, PluginCoordinator, PluginIntegrator, PluginRegistry, PluginScope,
};

# async fn run() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let root = std::env::current_dir()?;
let mut registry = PluginRegistry::new(root.join(".echo-agent"), Some(root));
registry.scan_all()?;
let id = registry.install(
    &InstallSource::Local("./review-tools".into()),
    PluginScope::Project,
)?;
let mut agent = ReactAgentBuilder::new().model("local-model").build()?;
let mut coordinator = PluginCoordinator::new(registry, PluginIntegrator::new());
coordinator.reconcile(&mut agent).await?;
coordinator.disable(&mut agent, &id).await?;
coordinator.enable(&mut agent, &id).await?;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Use `PluginRegistry::validate_plugin_dir` before installation when a validation report is required.
`PluginScope` implements `FromStr`, including the documented short forms (`u`,
`p`, and `l`), so callers can parse configuration and command input with the
standard `scope.parse()` API.

## Design references

This design reuses the official Agent Plugins 1.0 [manifest](https://agent-plugins.org/plugin-authors/manifest), [Skills](https://agent-plugins.org/plugin-authors/skills), [MCP](https://agent-plugins.org/plugin-authors/mcp-servers), and [loading](https://agent-plugins.org/client-implementers/loading-and-discovery) contracts. embedding application intentionally uses fixed root locations for its additional local-assistant components instead of introducing client-extension namespaces.
