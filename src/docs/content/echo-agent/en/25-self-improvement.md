# Self-Evolution System — Analyze, Evolve, Skill Creation

## Overview

The self-evolution system lets the Agent **continuously improve itself** from run experience: analyze failures, accumulate structured memory, **auto-create skills** from repeated patterns, merge/maintain stale skills, and promote high-confidence knowledge into permanent rules.

It consists of two complementary modules:

- [`improve`](../../src/improve) — **eval-driven** offline improvement: trajectory analysis, prompt suggestions, iterative tuning.
- [`evolution`](../../src/evolution) — **runtime evolution** loop: layered memory, change audit, skill lifecycle (candidate→draft→active), skill merge/health/patch, rule promotion, security.

```

## Problem It Solves

As tasks get harder and edge cases accumulate, Agent performance degrades. Without systematic improvement:

- **Repeating failure modes**: Agent writes before reading, over-retries failing tools, misses obvious tools
- **No feedback loop**: past failures don't affect future behavior
- **No experience memory**: every session starts from scratch
- **Skill staleness/redundancy**: skills go stale unnoticed, or multiple skills overlap
- **Knowledge never settles**: learned high-value experience stays ephemeral and never becomes a permanent rule

---

## Safety Model

Semantic proposals require human review. Deterministic memory maintenance and
explicit user-save/correction paths may write automatically, but the system **never automatically**:

- Modifies core runtime code
- Relaxes safety policies / changes permission rules
- Applies skill merges, patches, or rule promotions (it only generates proposals, applied by humans via commands)
- Promotes memory from untrusted sources (tool output) into the hot layer or rules

Layered memory mutations use a durable recovery operation before writing Store or `MEMORY.md`; their committed business changes are queryable in `change-log.jsonl`. Canonical layered memory also supports later rollback by settled `ChangeId` or `BatchId`; Skill and Rule rollback remain separate contracts (#54/#94/host owner). Memory writes also undergo secret scanning and prompt-injection detection.

## Part 1: Eval-Driven Improvement (`improve`)

### Analyzer — Failure Detection

`Analyzer` inspects a finished run trajectory and detects common failure modes:

```rust
use echo_agent::improve::Analyzer;

let critique = Analyzer::analyze(&run);
println!("{}", critique.format_report());
```

Output:

```
Run: run_abc123
Success: false (score: 0.65)

Issues found:
  - Write without read: write called 2x before read_file
  - Excessive retries: shell retried 4x

Suggestions:
  [prompt] tools: add instruction: 'always read_file before editing'
  [policy] force_read_before_edit: true — reason: write-before-read 2x
```

#### Detected Issue Types

| Issue | Detection logic | Suggestion |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| `WriteWithoutRead` | Write tool called on a file before a read tool | Add read-before-write prompt |
| `ExcessiveRetries` | Same tool errored > 2 times | Add "try a different approach" instruction |
| `ToolErrorPattern` | Same tool repeatedly fails | Generate eval cases for that tool |
| `ContextOverflow` | Context compression triggered | Suggest context-aware prompt |
| `MissingTool` | Expected tool not used | Suggest adding tool instruction |
| `ExcessiveToolCalls` | > 20 tool calls in one run | Add efficiency instruction |

### ImprovementLoop — Iterative Improvement

```rust
use echo_agent::improve::ImprovementLoop;

let loop_runner = ImprovementLoop {
    max_iterations: 5,
    improvement_threshold: 0.95,  // stop when test score >= 95%
    holdout_ratio: 0.4,           // 40% test, 60% train
};

let result = loop_runner.run(&cases, agent_factory, &run_store).await;
println!("Best score: {:.2} at iteration {}", result.best_score, result.best_iteration);
```

How it works: stratify cases by standard type to prevent overfitting → train eval → `Analyzer` critique → generate deduped suggestions → blind test eval on holdout → track best → early-stop at threshold.

### EvalDrivenImprovement — One Switch

> **Note**: the former `SelfEvolution` type has been **renamed** to `EvalDrivenImprovement` (to avoid a naming collision with the new `evolution` module).

```rust
use echo_agent::improve::EvalDrivenImprovement;

let result = EvalDrivenImprovement::new()
    .with_eval_cases(cases)
    .with_run_store(run_store)
    .max_iterations(5)
    .with_report_dir("./eval_reports")
    .enable()
    .run(|| create_agent())
    .await;
```

### PromptGenerator and TrajectorySaver

- `PromptGenerator` — uses an LLM to generate an improved system prompt based on `Analyzer` failure analysis.
- `TrajectorySaver` — converts finished runs into ShareGPT JSONL for model fine-tuning:

```rust
use echo_agent::improve::TrajectorySaver;

let saver = TrajectorySaver::default_dir()?;
saver.save(&run, "qwen3-max").await?;
let entries = saver.list(Some("2026-05-29")).await?;
```

---

## Part 2: Runtime Evolution Loop (`evolution`)

This is the core self-evolution capability added in `v0.2.x`, letting the Agent accumulate and reuse knowledge during runs.

### Typed Memory — `TypedMemoryStore`

Every memory carries structured metadata `MemoryMeta`: type, confidence, stability, risk, status, source, topic. Backward compatible — legacy untyped entries get default metadata on read.

The example below uses the low-level typed Store API. Entries intended for
runtime recall must instead be written through `MemoryLayerManager` and
reviewed before activation; a direct Store write does not perform its durable
operation, audit, or approval workflow.

```rust
use echo_agent::evolution::layer::WARM_NAMESPACE;
use echo_agent::memory::typed_store::{TypedMemoryStore, MemoryFilter};
use echo_agent::prelude::{MemoryMeta, MemorySource, MemoryType, MemoryStatus};

let store = TypedMemoryStore::new(arc_store);

// Write a memory with metadata
let meta = MemoryMeta::new(MemoryType::ProjectFact, MemorySource::UserCorrection, "build-tool")
    .with_confidence(0.9)
    .with_stability(0.8);
store
    .put_typed(WARM_NAMESPACE, "build:java8", "Project uses Java 8", meta)
    .await?;

// Filtered retrieval
let filter = MemoryFilter::new()
    .with_type(MemoryType::ProjectFact)
    .with_min_confidence(0.7);
let entries = store.list_typed(WARM_NAMESPACE, &filter).await?;
```

#### MemoryType categories

`UserPreference | ProjectFact | ArchitectureDecision | DebuggingLesson | ErrorResolution | CommandPattern | ToolUsage | WorkflowPattern | SkillCandidate | DeprecatedNote`

#### MemorySource and default confidence

| Source | Meaning | Default confidence |
|--------|---------|--------------------|
| `ExplicitSave` | `/remember` or `remember` tool | 1.0 |
| `UserCorrection` | Detected user correcting the Agent | 0.9 |
| `ErrorResolution` | Tool failed then succeeded with a different approach | 0.85 |
| `RepeatedWorkflow` | Same tool sequence observed ≥3 times | 0.75 |
| `AutoExtracted` | AutoMemory extracted from session archive | 0.6 |

### Tiered Memory Management — `MemoryLayerManager`

Memory is tiered by value; the hot tier is always in context, warm is retrieved on demand:

- **Hot** (`.echo-agent/MEMORY.md`): highest value, YAML frontmatter + markdown body, ~2000 token cap, editable by both humans and the Agent.
- **Warm** (Store KV `["agent","memories"]`): unified typed-memory store; organized by topic, loaded on demand. Memories can be `Active` or `Archived` (staleness is a recall-decay weight, not a layer move — Archived stays recallable with decay).
- **Separate cold storage** (optional API constant `COLD_NAMESPACE = ["agent", "cold_memories"]`): a consumer may implement its own archival tier. `MemoryLayerManager` does not read, write, or migrate that namespace; the constant and `MemoryLayer::Cold` do not enable a third tier in the manager.

```rust
use echo_agent::evolution::{MemoryLayerManager, JsonlChangeLog, MemoryMeta, MemorySource, MemoryType};
use std::path::PathBuf;

let mgr = MemoryLayerManager::try_new(
    PathBuf::from(".echo-agent"),
    arc_store,
    Box::new(JsonlChangeLog::new(PathBuf::from(".echo-agent/evolution/change-log.jsonl"))?),
)?;
mgr.reconcile_pending().await?; // before exposing this Store to independent readers

// Write (auto-scans secrets/injection, promotes to hot based on confidence)
let meta = MemoryMeta::new(MemoryType::ProjectFact, MemorySource::ExplicitSave, "deploy")
    .with_confidence(0.95);
mgr.write_memory("deploy:prod-script", "Build with pnpm build", meta).await?;

// Promote / demote
mgr.promote("some-key").await?;          // eligible warm→hot
mgr.demote("some-key", "stale").await?;  // hot→warm or warm→Archived

// Cross-tier search
let hits = mgr.search_layered("deploy", 10).await?;
```

### Change Audit — `ChangeLog`

Committed layered-memory changes are recorded in a filterable append-only JSONL; other evolution producers have their own audit contracts:

```rust
use echo_agent::evolution::{ChangeFilter, ChangeType, EntityType};

let filter = ChangeFilter::new()
    .with_entity_type(EntityType::Memory)
    .with_change_type(ChangeType::Promote)
    .with_limit(50);
// log file: .echo-agent/evolution/change-log.jsonl
```

For `MemoryLayerManager`, `.echo-agent/evolution/memory-operations.jsonl` is the
separate crash-recovery authority. A SyncData-confirmed prepared operation
contains the stable change IDs and target values before Store/`MEMORY.md`
mutation. The manager applies the projection, appends those IDs to the business
`ChangeLog` idempotently, and settles the operation. A failure after prepare
returns an uncertain outcome; `reconcile_pending().await?` finishes it after
restart without duplicate business audit. Reconciliation also checks settled
keys against the latest journal target, repairing a Store projection that lost
its durability barrier. Synchronous hot reads fail before startup recovery or
while an operation is pending; manager async reads reconcile before returning.
Raw Store or file readers can observe a prepared intermediate state and must
wait for startup reconciliation. Observers fire only after live settlement and
are not replayed after restart. See [ADR 0065](../adr/0065-evolution-memory-audit-reconciliation.md).

Hot entries with newlines or surrounding whitespace carry `content_json: true`
in `MEMORY.md` frontmatter and a JSON-escaped body bullet, preserving the
exact text through promotion and demotion; legacy plain bullets remain valid.
A promotion or demotion based on a stale read fails before prepare when another
manager has already changed that key.

### Evidence-Bound Draft and Activation

`MemorySource` names the extraction mechanism; `MemoryProvenance` separately
records the exact user, assistant, or tool excerpts and derived trust.
Automatic producers and the layered `remember` tool persist Drafts.
`write_memory` cannot activate a record by accepting a caller-supplied
`Active` status or approval. A reviewer uses the same manager:

```rust,no_run
use echo_agent::prelude::MemoryApproval;
use echo_agent::evolution::MemoryLayerManager;

# async fn review(mgr: &MemoryLayerManager) -> echo_agent::error::Result<()> {
if let Some(proposal) = mgr.preview_activation("candidate-key").await? {
    let approval = MemoryApproval::new("review-123", "reviewer", 1_750_000_000);
    mgr.activate_draft(&proposal, approval).await?;
}
# Ok(())
# }
```

The proposal binds the exact content, metadata, and journal generation. A
stale value or A-to-B-to-A edit fails before mutation; retrying the same
settled approval returns the original activation result. A failed or
cancelled write retains journal debt for `reconcile_pending`. Only approved
Active/Archived memory can be recalled. Historical typed or hot records
without provenance remain readable for review, not model context. Recall
telemetry uses Store CAS and cannot restore an overwritten status or trust.
See [ADR 0070](../adr/0070-memory-provenance-and-recall-authority.md).

An approved `MemoryMerger` now binds to the same manager:

```rust
use echo_agent::evolution::MemoryMerger;
let outcome = MemoryMerger::new(&mgr).merge_group(&reviewed_group).await?;
```

### Memory Review and Deterministic Maintenance

Memory accumulates. `MemoryReviewer` only scores warm-layer staleness and detects
conflicts; it does not mutate content or status. `Dreaming` separately applies
deterministic recall/inactivity-based promotion, revival, and archival while
returning an explainable decision report. Semantic conflicts require an explicit
product-level approval before invoking the merge primitive:

```
staleness = age·0.35 + low_usage·0.20 + instability·0.20 + contradiction·0.20 + source_weakness·0.05
```

| Staleness | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| < 0.35 | Active |
| 0.35–0.50 | Active (review suggested) |
| 0.50–0.65 | Superseded candidate |
| ≥ 0.65 | Archived candidate |

```rust
use echo_agent::evolution::{MemoryReviewer, ReviewConfig};

let reviewer = MemoryReviewer::new();
let report = reviewer
    .review(&typed_store, &ReviewConfig::default())
    .await?;
// report.staleness_suggestions / report.conflict_proposals
```

`ReviewConfig::default()` disables session-end review and returns at most ten
conflict proposals with at most sixteen members each, bounding JSONL and context
growth. The framework retains an explicit `MemoryMerger`, but the reviewer never
invokes it. Applications should execute it only after user approval and retain
the before snapshot for undo.

### Evidence-linked Run Review — `BackgroundReviewer`

`BackgroundReviewer` treats the run transcript as untrusted evidence and requires
strict JSON output with an exact quote. It returns a structured `ReviewCandidate`;
the default is proposal-only. Only framework consumers that explicitly enable
`auto_persist_user_preferences` may persist a high-confidence user preference,
and that write is stored as Draft memory. Review methods return a lazy
`BackgroundReviewHandle`; its `ReviewIdentity` is available before polling and
binds the run ID to the deterministic persistence key. The handle directly polls
the caller-owned operation, so the framework adds no Tokio runtime prerequisite,
detached task, receipt registry, or shutdown owner. Applications must retain the
identity and perform admission, generation fencing, cancellation, evidence
settlement, and retry reconciliation in their own lifecycle owner. The review
response is capped at 512 tokens.

### Skill Lifecycle and Auto-Creation

#### Full lifecycle (Curator state machine)

```
Candidate → Draft → Active → Stale → Deprecated → Archived
```

`Curator` stores lifecycle state. Mutations are submitted through
`SkillMutationAuthority`; the former direct Curator mutation methods are no
longer public. The host reviews the exact preview digest and supplies a one-use
approval artifact:

```rust
use echo_agent::evolution::{SkillApprovalArtifact, SkillMutationAuthority};

let authority = Arc::new(SkillMutationAuthority::open(
    curator, change_log.clone(),
)?);
let preview = authority.preview(&request)?;
let approval = SkillApprovalArtifact::new(
    approval_id, &preview.operation_digest, approver, approved_at,
);
let receipt = authority.apply(request, approval).await?;
```

#### Auto-creating skills from observed patterns

1. **`SkillCandidateDetector`** scans `TypedMemoryStore` for `WorkflowPattern`/`DebuggingLesson` memory; when ≥3 entries share a topic with source `RepeatedWorkflow` → proposes a skill candidate.

   ```rust
   use echo_agent::evolution::{Curator, CuratorConfig, SkillCandidateDetector};
   let curator = Curator::new(CuratorConfig::default(), "<application-data>/evolution/curator-state.json");
   let detector = SkillCandidateDetector::new(curator);
   let report = detector.detect(&typed_store, &change_log).await?;
   // report.new_candidates / report.reinforced
   ```

   Creation and reinforcement share one private durable operation journal. Each
   detection pass reconciles prepared candidate payloads and stable idempotent
   `ChangeLog` entries before scanning. Report items are published only after
   settlement; a scan with no observation growth writes no payload or audit.
   `TypedMemoryStore`, `Curator`, and `ChangeLog` remain the payload, lifecycle,
   and append-only audit authorities respectively. Reserved Store and ChangeLog
   markers bind the journal to those concrete authorities, Store projection uses
   exact atomic compare-and-put, and Curator preserves the candidate authority
   lineage across legitimate Draft/Active transitions. Stores without atomic
   compare-and-put are rejected instead of falling back to a racy write;
   `EmbeddingStore` is one such wrapper because its derived vector index cannot
   share the inner payload commit. See
   [ADR 0068](../adr/0068-skill-candidate-mutation-audit-reconciliation.md).

2. **`SkillDraftGenerator`** generates a draft `SKILL.md` from a candidate via template, saved under the consumer-supplied evolution root at `skills/_drafts/<name>/SKILL.md`.

   ```rust
   use echo_agent::evolution::{SkillApprovalArtifact, SkillDraftGenerator};
   let gen = SkillDraftGenerator::new("<application-data>".into(), authority.clone());
   let preview = gen.preview_generate_from_candidate(&candidate, request_id).await?;
   let approval = SkillApprovalArtifact::new(
       approval_id, &preview.preview.operation_digest, approver, approved_at,
   );
   let result = gen.generate_from_preview(preview, approval).await?;
   // result.skill_md_path points to the generated draft
   ```

   Draft, Merge, and Patch use the same prepare → projection → idempotent audit
   → settle owner. Later rollback targets a retained change or batch, fences
   every file and lifecycle identity by journal generation, and writes a fresh
   inverse batch. Rule rollback is typed `HostOwned`; framework code never
   reconstructs Rule state from ChangeLog. See
   [ADR 0069](../adr/0069-skill-lifecycle-mutation-authority.md).

   One authority is permanently bound to the business `ChangeLog`'s canonical
   durable destination identity; copied markers at another path and logs
   without such an identity fail closed. Apply/reconcile/rollback do not accept another log. SKILL.md paths are
   canonical absolute identities and `after` bytes must be UTF-8. Exact bytes
   stay in the private recovery journal; business audit records path, hash,
   length, and a bounded secret-redacted summary. Curator projection uses
   per-Skill merge CAS, preserving unrelated candidate inserts.

   embedding application currently supplies `<application-data>`, so its drafts live at `<application-data>/skills/_drafts/<name>/SKILL.md`. That product-owned location should be verified against the [embedding application app-core source](https://github.com/EchoYue-lp/echo-agent-cli/tree/main/echo-agent-app-core/src).

3. After human review, `/skill-promote <name>` moves Draft → Active and the skill appears in the skill catalog.

### Skill Merge, Health, Patch

| Component | Scoring formula / behavior |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **SkillSimilarityDetector** | `description·0.25 + trigger·0.30 + scope·0.15 + tool·0.10 + pitfall·0.10 + co_activation·0.10`; ≥0.75 proposes merge, ≥0.90 strongly recommends |
| **SkillMerger** | Applies merge proposals: keeps the higher-activation skill as primary, absorbs the secondary's triggers and unique instructions; requires `/skill-merge <a> <b>` to apply |
| **SkillHealthMonitor** | `success_rate·0.30 + recent_success·0.20 + usage·0.10 + freshness·0.15 + approval·0.15 + cmd_validity·0.10`; ≥0.75 healthy, <0.55 unhealthy |
| **SkillPatcher** | Analyzes telemetry `common_failures` → generates `SkillPatch` (add precondition/tool/error-handling); requires `/skill-patch <name>` to apply |

```rust
use echo_agent::evolution::{SkillSimilarityDetector, SkillHealthMonitor};

let detector = SkillSimilarityDetector::new(arc_store.clone());
// pass current skill descriptors; ≥0.75 similarity yields merge proposals, applied via `/skill-merge`
let proposals = detector.scan_and_propose(&skill_descriptors, &change_log).await?;

let monitor = SkillHealthMonitor::new(arc_store);
for report in monitor.analyze_all_skills().await? {
    println!("{}: {:?}", report.skill_name, report.status);
}
```

### Rule Promotion (product layer)

`RulePromoter` is an embedding application product policy, not a framework persistence contract. embedding application currently reviews high-confidence memory proposals before writing approved rules to `<application-data>/learned-rules.md`; consult the [embedding application app-core source](https://github.com/EchoYue-lp/echo-agent-cli/tree/main/echo-agent-app-core/src) for the authoritative thresholds and workflow.

### Security Hardening — `EvolutionSecurityGuard`

- **Pre-write**: secret scanning (AWS `AKIA...`, GitHub `ghp_...`, `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`, etc.; matches replaced with `[REDACTED]`) + prompt-injection detection (e.g. "ignore previous" patterns)
- **Untrusted-input isolation**: memory from tool output gets `risk = High` and cannot be promoted to hot layer or rules without human approval
- **Rate limiting**: max 50 memory writes per session, max 5 skill patches per day
- `ChangeLog` remains an append-only audit. Later memory rollback is owned by
  `MemoryLayerManager::preview_rollback` and `rollback_memory`: target a
  `ChangeId` or complete `BatchId`, require every affected key to remain at the
  batch's latest journal generation, then commit a durable inverse batch.
  Results distinguish `Ready`, `Conflict`, and `HistoryUnavailable`; a stable
  request ID makes retries return the original receipt. Its append-only audit
  records the actual inverse type and exact before/after warm/hot projection.
  Merge members are always rolled back as one batch. Skill and Rule rollback
  remain outside this memory-only contract (#54/#94/host owner).

---

## Automatic Memory Responsibility Boundaries

There are three automatic memory paths with strictly divided responsibilities to avoid redundant systems:

| System | Primary responsibility | Should NOT do |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| `TriggerDetector` (runtime) | Lightweight online discovery with exact source excerpts; direct persistence remains the framework default, while products may install `MemoryTriggerSink` | Session-archive summarization, product review policy |
| Application observation policy | Applications may extract observations and submit accepted facts through the typed-memory API | Compression/eviction, runtime policy scheduling |
| `memory_promoter` (compression path) | Lifecycle management of messages compressed/evicted due to token pressure (persist, evict, demote) | New-preference discovery, UI-triggered extraction |
| `BackgroundReviewer` (explicit/app-scheduled) | Evidence-linked JSON candidate from a finished run; proposal-only by default | Automatic durable writes or product scheduling policy |

> Key constraint: any accepted typed memory that enters runtime recall **must** go through `MemoryLayerManager::write_memory`. Extraction and review policy belong to the embedding application.

---

## Layered Memory Files

```
.echo-agent/
  MEMORY.md                        # hot tier (human-readable)
  evolution/
    memory-operations.jsonl        # recovery journal owned by MemoryLayerManager
    change-log.jsonl               # default business audit path for MemoryRuntimeIntegrationBuilder
```

The warm tier is Store KV under `WARM_NAMESPACE`, not a `memory/topics` or
`memory/archive` directory. A consumer supplies the Store implementation and
root path; the change-log path is configurable. Other product files and skill
artifacts have separate ownership.

## Store Namespaces

| Namespace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `["agent", "memories"]` | `WARM_NAMESPACE`: unified typed warm tier, including `MemoryStatus::Archived` |
| `["agent", "cold_memories"]` | Optional `COLD_NAMESPACE` constant for a consumer-owned separate tier; not read or written by `MemoryLayerManager` |
| `["agent", "skill_candidates"]` | skill candidate proposals |
| `["agent", "skill_telemetry"]` | skill telemetry |
| `["agent", "profile"]` | Agent profile |
| `["agent", "evolution", "patches"]` | skill patches |
| `["agent", "evolution", "merges"]` | merge proposals |
| `["agent", "evolution", "rules"]` | rule proposals |

---

## Feature Flags and Usage Modes

`evolution` ships with the framework by default; `improve` and `eval` are feature-gated:

```toml
[dependencies]
echo_agent = { version = "0.2", features = ["improve"] }
```

The base `improve` feature provides explicit trajectory export and compatibility
re-exports. `BackgroundReviewer` and `Curator` belong to the default `evolution`
module. Eval-driven analysis requires both features:

```toml
echo_agent = { version = "0.2", features = ["improve", "eval"] }
```

The self-evolution system is **not built into the Agent loop**; it runs as an independent analysis/evolution pass, keeping the Agent lightweight:

```
Production (no self-evolution):  agent.execute("do the task").await
Self-improvement (offline pass): EvalDrivenImprovement::new()...run(agent_factory).await
Runtime evolution:               MemoryLayerManager / TriggerDetector / ReviewIntegration integration
```

### Difference from Self-Reflection

| Dimension | Self-Reflection | Self-Evolution |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| When | During Agent execution | After / continuously at runtime |
| Scope | Single task | Cross-task patterns |
| Feedback | Language (LLM critique) | Structured (memory, skills, rules) |
| Feature flag | `self-reflection` | `improve` + `evolution` |
| Integration | Built into Agent loop | External batch / runtime evolution |

See also: [24 - Eval System](./24-eval-system.md) for the evaluation framework driving the `improve` pipeline; [03 - Memory](./03-memory.md) for the underlying Store.
